## When to do reasearch and testing
When your time and budget is limited, picking the most appropiate moment to carry out user
research is crucial.

Doing research and testing can help speed up development process, avoid unecessary meetings and conflicts.
If you have some breaks (a feature was not delivered in time, features are still in progress of being written), you
have time to perform some research and testing.
Testing with users is better than making things up by ourselves, even if its only one person, it help a lot and
you will have actual data to work on.

When you test even with 3 users you can catch 75% of the problems.
Avoid doing research and testing if you DON'T have a clear idea or reason.

## Questions to make Post-Launch
- Where do People drop out?
- What is stopping people from completing their task.
- How can we increase conversion
- What will work better?

## Prioritize your Audience
- **Business Alignment.** Prioritize groups directly contribuiting to key metrics such as revenue, market share, or strategic grow areas.
- **User Impact.** Groups whose needs, if met, would significantly enhance overall user satisfaction and engagement should be prioritize.
- **Needs.** Prioritize user groups with the most acute pain points, especially if these are barriers to projects goals.
- **Growth Potential.** Larger or rapidly growing segments may offer more value in the long term.
- **Regulatory Requirements.** Legal and Regulatory requirements migh influence which groups of users needs to be prioritize.
- **Feasibility.** Consider Practical aspects of reaching and engaging each user group.  


## Testing Prototypes
- **Ease of Use.** How Easily users can navigate and understand the prototype.
- **Navigation.** Is the prototype easy to navigate? Are the navigation elements logically and consistently placed?
- **Learnability** How fast can new users learn the prototype? Any confusing Features?
- **Efficency**
- **Satisfaction.** How likely are users to use the prototype as a real product.
- **Accesibilty.** Test with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.
- **Content Comprehensibility** Is the text content easy to read and understand.
- **Conversion Paths** Identify any drop-off points.
- **Interactivity** Test interactive elements for functionality, user-friendliness and error handling.

## When's the best time to Test?
The best moment for testing is during the Prototype phase. Its the time where the cost is less, you can save money to the company.

When preseting prototypes or being in meetings, try to always add clips(videos, gifs) and data to backup up your ideas and let them
know about how this will benefit the organization and the project which can be: saving money, saving time (less development time), among
others.
